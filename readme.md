# AI CV Chat Bot 🤖

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my CV chatbot project. This little buddy helps recruiters and anyone interested chat with my CV in a super natural way using Google's Gemini AI. Pretty cool, right?

## What's This All About? 🤔

This is a fun project that lets you have a conversation with my CV. Instead of scrolling through pages of text, you can just ask questions and get straight answers! It uses:

- Google's Gemini AI for the brains 🧠
- React/Next.js for the pretty face ✨
- Python/Flask for the heavy lifting 💪
- A sprinkle of magic ✨

## Want to Try It Out? 🚀

### First Things First:
1. Clone this bad boy:

cd src
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api.py


### Getting the Frontend Going 💅

### The Final Touch 🎯
1. Grab yourself a Gemini API key from Google
2. Pop that key into the app when it asks
3. Start chatting!

## Sample Questions to Get You Started 💭
